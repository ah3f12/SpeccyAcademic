We need to collect some ideas for what the game's going to be about. Please add your own! So far we have:

1. The adventures of an academic trying to find funding

2. A MUD (?!) where gamers find scraps of manuscript and have to merge and version them into a complete spell tome

3. Centuries after a catyclsm, you roam the wastes in search of the sacred artefact known only as 'BBC Micro'.

4. You're a cat and you're learning to program. Who needs humans?

5. Hired to kill five individuals, your aim is to make each hit look like an accident.

6. You're an alien parasite that's just taken over a dead body - now you have to convince his friends and family that he's still alive...

7. Do you what? Backwards going is time. 

8. Can a sleazy tabloid journalist publish their shocking exclusive on time?

9. School kids accidentally summon Cthulhu during a geometry lesson - can you save their sanity and get them past Key Stage 3? 

10. As a keen gardener, you talk to your plants, but can you persuade them to grow to award-winning sizes?
